<h1>CS4482a: TOOLS 3 – Dialog Editor</h1>

This project is a simple tool to allow game designers to add dialog trees to a game within the Unity
Game Engine. The purpose of this project was to learn how to create tools in Unity by
extending the editor. This tool borrows the localization tool developed previously simply by copying
the relevant files for the tool: https://github.com/Amazao2/Localization_Tool 

WARNING: Code formatting and comments are almost non-existant. Functionality and learning the
engine's interface where the primary concern on this small project. I may revisit the code and
add comments in the future as a learning exercise.

</br>TOOLS 3 – Dialog Editor

<b>1 Introduction</b>

You’ve managed to create some tools to ensure people, whose first language is not English,
can read the content of your game. Now it’s time to do something useful with that established
base. You must create a dialog editor that leverages your language data in order to
create dialog trees for NPC characters in your game.
<ol type=1>
  <li>Use the Unity3D Editor API to create your tools.</li>
  <li>Create a simple dialog editor with no less than 3 response branches supported.</li>
  <li>Allow the language of the dialogs to be set using your localization system.</li>
</ol>

<b>2 Miscellaneous</b>

If you would like to write your tools in another system, SDK, C# (WPF), or otherwise,
that’s OK too, but please send me an e-mail and we’ll discuss other options.
